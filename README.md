### How the Game Work

Your main goal should be converting this static project to users friendly. For that you have to make a plan and approach each task at a time. The following are some goals that you have to achieve in order to make this project interactive:

| Strategies | Description. |

### Development

Since, I am a beginner in javascript. I was having hard time to figure out where to begin. I realized that each person have unique way to start and finish any project.  All you need is hardwork and dedication. 

The following are some guideline for this project. I actually implemented following steps. Hope it might help you.

```sh
1. "Where should i start!!!" Its okay to have that thought.
2.I start with  "click evenlistener". I want to click and see each card.
3. Matching card. clue "open show match" else "unmatch". Also, "Disable" for double click. 
4.Move counter:2 moves ===1 count .
5. Stars length depends on your moves. It will reduce if you click more cards.
5. Timer should be start once you click first card and stop after the last click.
6. Pop-up card should display once you matched all the cards.
```

For Outcome

```sh
If any confusion, "Console.log" helps you understand overall picture of your code.

```
